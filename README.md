# Traveling Ethiopia Problem

## Overview

The **Traveling Ethiopia Problem** is an interactive application built with Streamlit to solve various graph traversal challenges on Ethiopia's road network. It leverages algorithms like BFS, DFS, Weighted BFS, Dijkstra, A*, and more. The application features:

* **Pathfinding** : Determine optimal paths between cities.
* **All-Pairs Shortest Paths** : Visualize shortest paths between all cities.
* **Traverse All Cities** : Visit every city exactly once or allow repeated visits.

## Features

### 1. Traveling Ethiopia Problem

* **Description** : This module solves pathfinding problems between two selected cities using different search algorithms.
* **Inputs** :
* Start City
* Goal City (optional)
* Strategy (BFS, DFS, Weighted BFS, Dijkstra, A*)
* **Outputs** :
* Path and its cost
* Visualization of the road network with the path highlighted.

### 2. All Pairs Shortest Paths

* **Description** : Computes and visualizes shortest paths between all pairs of cities.
* **Algorithms** :
* **Floyd-Warshall** : Computes the shortest path matrix for all city pairs.
* **Bellman-Ford** : Computes shortest paths from a selected city to all other cities.
* **Outputs** :
* A matrix representation of shortest paths.
* Visualization for Bellman-Ford as a row matrix for the selected city.

### 3. Traverse All Cities

* **Description** : Traverses all cities in Ethiopia starting from a selected city.
* **Modes** :
* **Only Once Visit** : Ensures each city is visited exactly once.
* **Repeated Visit** : Allows revisiting cities if necessary.
* **Inputs** :
* Start City
* Strategy (BFS, DFS)
* **Outputs** :
* Path taken to traverse all cities.
* Visualization of the traversal path.

## Algorithms Used

### Pathfinding Algorithms:

1. **BFS** (Breadth-First Search): Finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.
2. **DFS** (Depth-First Search): Explores paths deeply to find feasible paths.
3. **Weighted BFS** : Uses cumulative path cost as a priority heuristic.
4. **Dijkstra** : Finds the shortest path based on edge weights.
5. **A** *: Optimized pathfinding with a heuristic function.

### All-Pairs Shortest Path Algorithms:

1. **Floyd-Warshall** : Computes shortest paths between all pairs of nodes.
2. **Bellman-Ford** : Computes shortest paths from a single source node, handling negative edge weights.

### Traversal Algorithms:

1. **Traverse All Cities** : Visits every city exactly once.
2. **Traverse All Cities with Revisits** : Visits every city, allowing revisits if necessary.
